		Thinking Hats Technique”. Each team approached the topic from a different perspective, according
		to the color of hat they represented. All teams made excellent presentations, approaching the
		topic from a variety of angles. They also asked and answered each other's questions. At the end
		of the discussion, the participating students voted for the popularity award, and the jury
		members from each school awarded the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd prizes. BTSO Ali Osman Sönmez Sosyal
		Bilimler Lisesi received the popularity award and the 3rd prize, Liceul Teoretic "Emil Racovita"
		received the 2nd prize, and Liceum Ogolnoksztalcace im. Adama Mickiewicza w Tarnowie was awarded
